switch between two Icecast if one feed is silence


To switch between two Icecast audio streams in Node.js and stream the selected stream to an Icecast server, you can use the icecast-client module. Here is a high-level outline of the steps you could take:

1- Install the icecast-client module using npm.
2- Use the icecast.get method to create a client for each of the Icecast streams.
3- Connect to the first stream and start streaming.
4 Periodically check the volume of the audio being streamed using the AudioContext and AnalyserNode objects in the web-audio-api module.
If the volume falls below a certain threshold, stop the stream and switch to the other stream.
Connect to the endpoint Icecast server and start streaming the selected stream to it.


This code will switch between the two streams if either one becomes silent, and stream the selected stream to the endpoint Icecast server. It will keep switching back and forth between the streams and streaming to the endpoint server until the program is terminated.

Note that this code assumes that both streams and the endpoint server are in the same format (e.g. all are stereo MP3 streams at 44.1kHz). If the streams or the endpoint server have different formats, you will need to modify the code to handle the different formats appropriately.
